    <h3>Corona Fear in Nepal</h3>
    <p>The primary duty of medical professionals is to provide care to all the patients who come to them without
      any discrimination and to do the best to save peopleâ€™s lives. This is their social as well as professional duty.
      But ever since the number of people infected with COVID-19 gradually started to go up in Nepal, many doctors across the country,
      including in Kathmandu valley, have started refusing to attend to patients with fever and dry cough.</p>
